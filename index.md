  <h1>I Came From A Technical Background</h1>
    <p>  
		My favorite toy as a kid was LEGO.  I don't remember if I had asked for it first or that my mom just got it for me without me asking.  Either way it helped me start down the path of becoming a technical professional.  There's something inherently simple, but yet complex about LEGO.  Before you could play with it you need to build it.  It comes with so many parts that unless you follow the instruction manual it will not come out looking like the picture on the box.  Without knowing it, I was being trained to become an engineer.  Before long I didn’t need to follow the manual to play LEGO.  I knew what kind of parts would best fit my design and I could imagine what I wanted to build before it was built.  Thinking back now, it instilled the concept of Turing-completeness, which I am barely beginning to learn about.<a id="i-came-from-a-technical-background-sup-1" href="#i-came-from-a-technical-background-ref-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Before entering college I really didn’t have a clue about what engineers did nor the various fields that they worked in.  I just knew that I was good at math and I really enjoy understanding and building things.  I also knew that engineers had handsome salaries and cushy desk jobs.  At college app time most of my friends and I included all applied to engineering majors.  I for one decided upon ME because after a night of Google (maybe Yahoo at the time) search yielded that mechanical engineering had the highest paying salary.  After my first year of college I switch to EE due to another night of Google search.  Long story short my first job after college landed me a job to build power plants across mostly the mid-west of US.  It was a whole year of physical engineering that I enjoyed, but in the end wasn’t for me.  I quit.
	</p>
	<p>
		Upon returning home I began dappling in this thing they call “The Internet”.  I grew tired of asking friends to make me websites so decided to learn web development.  The irony of it is that I had reframed from considering majoring in CS in college because I didn’t want a job where I sit in front of the computer all day.  Now I am learning the art of coding and I cannot stop.  I feel like a kid again playing with LEGO for the first time.  LEGO manuals are now API docs.  LEGO parts are now languages, frameworks, and modules.  I was born to do this!  Never had I imagine it would be this fun to write gibberish on the computer.  As of this writing I have been developing for about 4 years.  I’m still a baby learning my “ABC” and I attribute my ability to grasp this material to playing with LEGO as a kid.
